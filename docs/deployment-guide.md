This guide provides high-level steps for deploying the SAP & Oracle Reports Analysis solution to Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying:
- Microsoft Copilot Studio admin access
- Power Platform environment with sufficient privileges
- Microsoft 365 admin access (for Teams integration, if needed)
- **SharePoint admin access** for PDF content storage and management

## üîç Deployment Overview

The deployment process consists of importing our pre-configured solution package and performing minimal configuration to connect it to your environment.

## üì¶ Import Solution Package

1. **Download Solution Package**
   - Navigate to the `src/solution` folder in this repository

4. **Verify Import Success**
   - Ensure all components are imported without errors
   - Check that the "SAP Oracle Reports Analyzer" Copilot appears in your list

## üîí Security Configuration for Confidential Documents

**IMPORTANT**: SAP EWA and Oracle AWR reports contain sensitive system information that must be protected according to your organization's security policies.

1. **Implement Power Platform Security Policies**
   - Consult with your security team to ensure alignment with corporate policies
   - Navigate to the Power Platform Admin Center
   - Go to "Environments" > [Your Environment] > "Settings" > "Security"
   - Configure Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies specifically for SAP/Oracle data
   - Apply appropriate classification labels (e.g., "Confidential", "Internal Only")
   - Enable audit logging for all access to report data

2. **Configure Data Encryption**
   - Ensure all data is encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Configure customer-managed keys if required by your policies
   - Implement column-level encryption for sensitive fields if needed

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement least-privilege access principles
   - Create dedicated security roles for report access
   - Configure conditional access policies if needed
   - Enable multi-factor authentication for accessing confidential reports

4. **Compliance Settings**
   - Configure data retention policies according to your compliance requirements
   - Set up data residency constraints if applicable
   - Implement any industry-specific or regulatory compliance measures

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Environment-Specific Settings

1. **Connection Configuration**
   - Navigate to the imported Copilot
   - Go to "Connections" in the settings
   - Update SharePoint connection to point to your document libraries
   - Configure environment variables with your system-specific values

2. **Knowledge Base Configuration**
   - Go to "Knowledge Base"
   - Select the imported knowledge base
   - Click "Refresh" to ensure it's updated with your latest settings
   - Upload sample report files from your environment (if available)

3. **Authentication Setup**
   - Navigate to "Security" settings
   - Update authentication settings to match your organization's requirements
   - Connect to your Azure AD instance for user authentication

## üîó SharePoint Integration for PDF Content Storage

1. **SharePoint Site Configuration**
   - Create a dedicated SharePoint site for Copilot-generated content (if not already available)
   - Set up the following document libraries:
     - `AnalysisReports`: For storing generated analysis PDFs
     - `ExtractedInsights`: For storing structured data extracted from reports
     - `HistoricalData`: For storing historical analysis for trend comparison

2. **Configure SharePoint Permissions**
   - Ensure the Copilot's service account has **Contribute** permissions to the document libraries
   - Set up appropriate security groups:
     - `Report_Creators`: Users who can initiate report generation
     - `Report_Viewers`: Users who can view but not modify reports
     - `Report_Admins`: Users who can manage all content
   - Apply Information Rights Management (IRM) to prevent unauthorized sharing

3. **Setup PDF Content Offloading**
   - In Copilot Studio, navigate to "Settings" > "Content Management"
   - Configure the PDF generation settings:
     - Enable "Generate PDF for analysis reports"
     - Select SharePoint as the storage destination
     - Configure naming convention: `{ReportType}_{SystemID}_{Date}_{AnalysisType}.pdf`
     - Set retention policy (e.g., 90 days for standard reports)
     - Enable document sensitivity labels for all generated PDFs

4. **Configure Power Automate Flow for Content Management**
   - Import the provided flow from `src/flows/pdf_content_manager.zip`
   - Update connection references to your SharePoint site
   - Configure notification settings for when new reports are generated
   - Enable version history tracking for all generated documents
   - Implement automated classification of documents based on content sensitivity

## üß™ Test the Deployment

1. **Validation Testing**
   - Use the "Test your bot" feature in Copilot Studio
   - Try sample queries such as:

     - "Show me critical issues from yesterday's Oracle AWR report"
     - "Compare performance metrics from last week to this week"
     - "Generate a PDF report of database performance trends"

2. **Verify PDF Generation and Storage**
   - Request a full analysis report during testing
   - Confirm the PDF is generated correctly
   - Verify it's stored in the designated SharePoint location
   - Check permissions are working as expected
   - Verify that security classifications are correctly applied

3. **Security Testing**
   - Attempt to access reports with unauthorized accounts
