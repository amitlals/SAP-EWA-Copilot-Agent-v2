This document outlines security best practices for implementing the Microsoft Copilot Studio solution for SAP EWA and Oracle AWR report analysis. Given the confidential nature of these technical reports, proper security measures are essential.

## Understanding the Sensitivity of Technical Reports

SAP EWA and Oracle AWR reports contain highly sensitive information including:
- System configuration details
- Performance metrics
- Potential vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure architecture
- User and account information
- Database structures and statistics

Unauthorized access to this information could potentially facilitate system attacks or expose critical business operations.

## Power Platform Security Framework

### 1. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies

Implement DLP policies specifically for this solution:

- **Create a dedicated Business data group** for SAP/Oracle report connectors
- **Block sharing** of report data to non-business connectors
- **Implement custom connectors** with proper authentication for SAP/Oracle systems
- **Enable DLP alerts** for unauthorized access attempts

### 2. Environment Security

- **Use a dedicated environment** for this solution
- **Configure environment-level data policies**
- **Implement environment-level access control**
- **Enable audit logging** for all activities

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **Enforce Strong Authentication**:
  - Require multi-factor authentication
  - Implement conditional access policies
  - Use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) security groups

- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - Create specific security roles for report access
  - Implement least-privilege principles
  - Separate duties between administrators and users

### 4. Data Handling

- **Data Classification**:
  - Apply appropriate sensitivity labels
  - Use Microsoft Purview for data governance
  - Implement automatic classification based on content

- **Encryption**:
  - Ensure encryption at rest and in transit
  - Consider customer-managed keys for sensitive data
  - Use SharePoint IRM for document protection

## SharePoint Security for Report Storage

### 1. Site Collection Security

- **Create a dedicated site collection** for report storage
- **Implement site-level access restrictions**
- **Configure external sharing settings** to prevent unauthorized sharing
- **Enable SharePoint audit logging**

### 2. Document Library Configuration

- **Configure versioning** to track changes
- **Implement check-in/check-out** for critical documents
- **Set up approval workflows** for sensitive reports
- **Use column-level security** for sensitive metadata

### 3. Document Protection

- **Apply sensitivity labels** to all generated documents
- **Configure Information Rights Management (IRM)** to prevent unauthorized actions:
  - Restrict printing
  - Prevent copying of content
  - Disable downloading in certain contexts
  - Apply watermarks to sensitive documents

- **Set up retention policies** aligned with your organization's data lifecycle

## Microsoft Copilot Studio Security

### 1. Data Handling in Copilot Studio

- **Minimize data processing** - only extract necessary information
- **Implement session timeouts** for inactive users
- **Clear conversation history** after analysis completion
- **Use system-managed identities** for connections when possible

### 2. AI Content Filters

- **Configure content filters** to prevent exposure of sensitive information
- **Implement prompt security** to prevent prompt injection attacks
- **Set up input validation** for all user queries
- **Control context window size** to limit information exposure

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. Regulatory Compliance

Ensure your implementation meets relevant compliance requirements:
- GDPR if processing EU data
- HIPAA for healthcare organizations
- SOX for publicly traded companies
- Industry-specific regulations

### 2. Audit and Monitoring

- **Implement comprehensive audit trails** for all report access
- **Configure regular security reviews** of access patterns
- **Monitor usage analytics** for suspicious patterns
- **Set up alerts** for potential security violations

### 3. Data Residency

- Ensure data processing complies with data residency requirements
- Configure geographic boundaries for data storage if required
- Consider using Power Platform environments in specific regions

## Security Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist during implementation:

- [ ] Consulted with organization's security team
- [ ] Implemented appropriate DLP policies
- [ ] Configured environment security settings
- [ ] Set up proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Applied data classification and protection
- [ ] Configured SharePoint security for document storage
- [ ] Implemented appropriate retention policies
- [ ] Set up audit logging and monitoring
- [ ] Conducted security testing
- [ ] Documented security measures for compliance
- [ ] Created security training materials for users

## Recommended Security Tools

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps** - For monitoring access to SharePoint
- **Microsoft Purview** - For data governance and classification
- **Microsoft Sentinel** - For security monitoring and threat detection
- **Power Platform CoE Toolkit** - For governance and administration

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or to report potential vulnerabilities:
- Contact your organization's security team
- Submit issues via the repository's secure issue reporting process
- Reference the security response policy in your organization

Remember: Security is a continuous process, not a one-time implementation. Regularly review and update your security measures as threats evolve and new features become available.
